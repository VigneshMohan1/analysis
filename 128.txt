
I booked an Edinburgh to Perpignan flight with Air France and to my surprise, I received no frequent flyer miles. Nothing in
the documents I have printed indicate this, and at GBP 376 it was not the cheapest option. Today I received an email saying
they reward my loyalty and that "it always earns you more miles."  Air France certainly needs to look at their service,
especially as with code sharing their clients have a chance to compare them with other carriers.
