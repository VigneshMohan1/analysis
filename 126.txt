
The Air France Experience was "could do better". Our morning flight from Birmingham to Tunis, yesterday was an experience. We
checked in on time with two suit cases, for our short journey to Paris (CDG). Flight was enjoyable, however the breakfast was
poor, croissant stale, service slow. There were no signs at CDG telling us where our next connection was. All it needed was a
screen at the exit to show the flights, desks and connecting details. It left us wondering around between L & D2 and the Duty
Free. Fortunately, the plane took off late so we did not miss our  connection. However, the reason why it was late, some
passengers did not check in, so bags were unloaded (including ours as we later found out to our cost), and on arriving in
Tunis, one of our bags was missing. After a long wait in the baggage hall, we , with several other passengers, who had the
Air France experience, reported the loss, but as no one there could speak English we left, hoping that our bag would be sent
on to us. Twenty four hours later, it was not. We are still waiting for someone from the line to explain and return our
luggage. Air France is no better than Ryanair for it's service or passenger concern, and the cabin crew need retraining in
customer service.
