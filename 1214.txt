
Flew from Paris to Cayenne on April 2014 in business class. Overall, good experience, nice lounge in Paris Orly
West, fast track to go quickly from customs and police. Good seating on board with a 2x2x2 configuration, angle
lie flat NEV4 seat but very comfortable. Good food and excellent champagne. The crew were very attentive at every
moment. I noticed Air France will change soon business class seat on international haul flights on a 1x2x1
configuration, I hope it will soon include flights to the Caribbean.
