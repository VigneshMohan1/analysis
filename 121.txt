
We flew from Atlanta to Paris. From the minute we entered the international terminal in Atlanta GA to the minute
we left Paris on an Air Austria flight bound for Vienna I have nothing but wonderful things to say about AF. 
The staff in Atlanta went beyond their job description to make our check in and transition to the jet as perfect
as it could be. Yes the food isn't gourmet but it was hot, tasty and filling. We had a decent Merlot and our
stewardess served us each 2 little bottles of VSOP Cognac.  The cabin was clean and comfortable. A great selection
of movies. There was more leg room than on domestic flights. Service was kind and considerate. The cabin was
darkened and it was quiet and easy to rest. We were served a basic fruit/coffee/muffin breakfast, nothing fancy
but it was OK. All in all the best thing about AF is the people.
