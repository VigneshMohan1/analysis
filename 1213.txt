
If this is first class let me go back to business class. On an airbus A380 between JNB and CDG. No pre take off
drink as no welcome drink. Service just average, food nothing great. Do not know if 1st class product is up to it
from AF, was extremely disappointed and will not pay such a high price for such a bad service.
