was just poor and mean, the 2-3-2 seating is unacceptable - had preselected aisle seat but when went to checkin online had
been put in a middle seat. There was one available aisle left, row 12 with toilets behind. Everything was just tacky, lots of
plastic, and plastic wrapping on amenities - having disposable covers for the headphones is unpleasant - but probably
necessary since the headphones appear fixed in the seat. Entertainment offerings were basic, food exceedingly average.
amenities pack basic, blanket made of that rather nasty artificial velour-type material that feels like it will give you an
electric shock. Seats uncomfortable, headrest juts forwards, armrests solid so can't use as arm rests. They may be upgrading
their business class but should be discounting what they offer - I travel frequently and I've had better food,  entertainment
systems and amenities in other airline's premium economy. This experience was by far the least of any business class I've
flown in the last 5 years. Staff were fine, doing their job politely.
