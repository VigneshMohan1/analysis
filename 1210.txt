was pleasantly surprised. The seat was very comfortable, most so in a reclining position. When converted to bed,
was less so, but none the less satisfactory. The service was really good, very friendly and professional, having
recently taken Singapore Airlines on the same route I had low expectations. Food was lovely - quality, good
presentation and flavoursome. The IFE was not the best; difficult to navigate around, cumbersome - however had
some interesting films. Overall, I would recommend them for long hall business. Very pleasant journey and very
reasonably priced.
