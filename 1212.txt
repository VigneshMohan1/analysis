
Flight cancelled by 24 hours because the plane was leaking (which they only found out when we have already
boarded). Long awaited vacations had to be cut short by this whole day, as even though we were in their head
quarters in Paris, they had no airplanes to replace this. We had to wait in a bed and breakfast next to the hotel
for the whole day and night and Air France offered no compensation, terrible customer handling, no one properly
explains anything, their personnel are rude, entertainment screen for my husband did not work on the flight, the
staff are surprised by upset customers. We flew the next day, wish we had never flown with them, just a ruined
start to a long awaited vacation and no customer service, considering that we paid over 2000 euros for the
flights. Terrible airline, no customer service, airplanes broken, in such a competitive market I have no idea how
they still exist.
