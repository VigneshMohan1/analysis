
NRT to CDG. Staff courteous but not attentive nor particularly warm or friendly. Like the experiences of other reviewers
here, after the first meal had been cleared away, the crew appeared once with water and once with ice-cream then disappeared
before serving breakfast. Meals were poor but a selection of snacks (hot soup, sandwiches, cookies and drinks) were available
in the galley. The entertainment system was a disappointment after flying this route several times over the last years with
other airlines. The personal screen was small and hard to see and movie choices very limited, especially for children. My
biggest complaint was the standards of cleanliness. The plane was obviously quite old (with ashtrays still on the doors at
the back) and looked a little worse for wear (toilets looked particularly grubby) but there is no excuse for the lack of
cleaning. When I unclipped my try for the first meal, there was a used tissue stuck in there and the tray was covered in
crumbs. Someone had either been sick over or spilled their lunch over the (very bulky) airline magazine in the seat pocket of
my daughter, leaving it sticky and smelly. Somehow staff were unable to regulate the temperature in the plane and it was
quite cold (other passengers wrapping themselves up in whatever they had with them)- aside from 45 minutes or so in the
middle of the night when the heating system had obviously been turned on full-blast and the cabin turned into an oven. The
blankets looked very tatty and dirty and, when released from their meaningless plastic bag, proved to be covered in thick,
long black hairs. I opened all the bags of our party of four and they were all equally as filthy so went unused. In terms of
value, we booked the flight 9 months in advance and got a decent price but I hope I  never have to use AirFrance again.
