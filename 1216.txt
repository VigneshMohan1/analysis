for this plane and then at the meal they run out of food. You are offered either Chinese or Vegetarian trays you
walk away with a bad taste in your mouth. You truly think that after one week of Chinese food I want Vegetarian or
Chinese? Which part of "Business Class" do they fail to understand.
