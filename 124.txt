
JFK to Belgrade via Paris. Outbound we traveled in business and returned in premium economy. Awful experience in both
classes. It was worse on return in premium economy. The plane was old and dirty, seats very uncomfortable. The food was
awful. Stale breads, lack of taste, small portions. We were refused entry to the lounge on return in Paris, even though the
premium economy tickets state that we are permitted to use the business class lounge. I would not fly Air France again. And
on the way out they lost our luggage, all four pieces. There was absolutely no help with connecting flights in Paris. There
was not one person that we ran across at the airport who was helpful.
