
JFK-CDG on 05/06/2014 and then CDG-JFK on 05/20/2014. Both flights were very smooth with minimal turbulence during
both flights. Staff service on both flights were very good. Dinner, snacks and drinks were served in a timely
fashion. Seats were comfortable. On the return flight, two rows ahead of me were vacant so a few of us were moved
into them to break up the row and give us more space. I chose the Italian dinner from the A La Carte menu. Much
tastier than dinners I've had on other airlines. Solid selection of Movies/TV/Music and the headphones provided
were good quality. One of the better airlines I've flown with. Very positive experience.
