
Lisbon - Paris - Havana + Havana - Paris - Lisbon. On the way to Havana everything went ok, there was an entertainment system
onboard with recent movies and tv shows, though I would have appreciated a little more offer. The food was good for airline
meal. The check in was efficient in Lisbon and in Paris, but not so much on Havana. The flight back departed with an hour or
so delayed, because the crew of the flight arrived late, making me lose my connecting flight to Lisbon, with more than 4
hours difference from what was schedule. I was offered a voucher for a sandwich + drink. I won't fly again with Air France,
because even though nothing serious happened, it could have, because they showed at various levels lack of reliability.
They offer good discounts sometimes and their economy class is very good; but if you like punctuality you should look for
other airliners.
