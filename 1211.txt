
AF Premium Economy is an upgrade to an already good Economy product, at least on the Airbus A380. Noteworthy - and
better than on BA - is that on short-haul flights to Pairs with Air France, PE passengers are seated in Business
and receive business class service. Only the middle seat is not free as in Business. On my flight from CDG to SFO
the crew were very friendly, the food was good and the PE seats provide a lot of private space. I could sleep for
a few hours, but people who complain that the shell seats are too hard will be pleased to hear that AF also
replaces the cushions in the A380 seats (and improve the touchscreen). You get an amenity kit, sky priority
boarding and check in, plus a slightly better main meal. No pre-flight cocktails and certainly not the enhanced
catering as on Air New Zealand. However, if you need to work and/or want to watch a few movies in a comfortable
environment and cannot afford business class, then AF PE is definitely worth checking out.
