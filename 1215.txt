
January 2014 - AF 347, Montreal - CDG and AF 342, from CDG to Montreal in business. Experienced the usual insult
again by the AF staff. If you are not French you don't count at AF, even if you do your best to address the staff
in French. Big difference with the friendliness shown by the staff a sister company KLM. Seats are OK, but I don't
understand that when AF overhauled their business class some years ago they didn't go for flat beds (even not on
the brand new A380). Food is OK, although why is the bread always stale?
