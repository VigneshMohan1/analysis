board food in Economy compared to their competitors. Also, the flight attendants were courteous and actually
smiled which was great especially in comparison to the "smile less" Lufthansa flight attendants. The inflight
entertainment selection was ok. However, the coach transfers is a pain really but other than that,
AF is cool on this route and equally offers good fare prices to same. Its AF for now and the foreseeable future.
